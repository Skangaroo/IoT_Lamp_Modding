Mod to repurpose rechargeable USB lamps based on a mass produced "KN-L8837LA-1-SMT" board. 
This aims to completely replace the board with an ESP32 as the main controller. 
Currently I'm using the nRF Connect application on my android to send data to the ESP. I will be building an app once all of my planned features are added on the ESP side.
Cheerio!
